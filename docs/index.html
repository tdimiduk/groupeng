  <h1> GroupEng </h1>

  <hr>

  <p>GroupEng is an open source (AGPLv3) program that makes it easy for 
 instructors to assign students to groups for projects or groupwork, 
even with  large classes.  </p>

 <p> GroupEng was written specifically to help instructors follow 
education research guidelines for improving student, and especially 
minority, performance in group project based classwork.  It allows 
instructors to think at an abstract level about what properties they 
want student groups to have; GroupEng handles the details of optimizing 
the groups to meet those criteria.  </p>

<p> GroupEng operates on class data from an excel spreadsheet (exported 
to a .csv text file) and forms groups of students based on grouping 
rules supplied by the instructor.  These rules are defined using four 
grouping operators:
  </p><ul>
	<li> <b> Distribute</b>: Spread students with some attribute (major, a 
needed skill) across all groups so that each group has about the same 
number of them </li>
	<li> <b> Aggregate</b>: Group students with some attribute (project choice, section number) together in the same groups</li>
	<li> <b> Cluster</b>: Ensure that students with some attribute (women, 
minorities) are not isolated in a group (there will be at least 2 of 
them in a group)</li>
	<li> <b> Balance</b>: Ensure equal strength of groups based on some numeric score (GPA, pretest).  </li>
  </ul>

You specify class data, desired group size, and an ordered list of 
grouping rules (earlier rules are given higher priority) in a simple 
text file, and GroupEng does the rest, outputting a grouping of the 
students, as well as statistics of how well it was able to meet your 
rules.  GroupEng has a random element, so different runs with the same 
rules will generate different groups.  
  
  <h2>Download </h2>
     
  <a href="https://groupeng.org/files/groupeng-1.3.zip"> GroupEng v1.3 </a>

  <p> GroupEng requires only <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.  If you are using a Mac, you already have python, but if it fails try <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-macosx10.6.pkg">this</a> version.  </p>

  <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.python/downloads/" Download> and install python if necessary, then download and unpack the GroupEng archive.</li>
    <li> Write a group description file telling GroupEng how to make 
groups for your class, see the sample files in the archive for examples.</li>
    <li> Run GroupEng either by double-clicking the GroupEng.py file in 
the archive and selecting your input file in the file chooser that 
appears, or at a command line specifying the location of your input file
 as an argument </li>
  </ul>

We also have much more detailed <a href="https://groupeng.org/files/GroupEng_Instructions.pdf">instructions</a> if you want them.  
  
  <p> GroupEng is still fairly experimental software.  I hope it is useful to
  you, but it is still a little rough around the edges.  Feel free
  to <a href="mailto:tom@dimiduk.net"> contact me </a> if you have any problems
  using GroupEng </p>

  <h2> Documentation and Publications </h2>

  <p> Kathryn's <a href="https://groupeng.org/files/ASSE_Lawrence_GroupEng_Workshop.pdf">talk</a> on GroupEng at the ASEE Lawrence Section in March 2012.  

      </p><p> We presented <a href="https://groupeng.org/files/GroupEng_Talk_WEPAN.pdf">talk</a> and <a href="https://groupeng.org/files/GroupEng_Paper_WEPAN.pdf">paper</a> on GroupEng at the 2011 WEPAN conference in Seattle.  </p>

      <p>These documents give a good introduction and overview of 
GroupEng and how  you should think about using it.  We have simplified 
the input files since those documents were written, so follow the 
example that comes with the program instead of the directions in the 
paper.   </p>

  <h2> Development / Bugs </h2>

  GroupEng is on <a href="https://github.com/tdimiduk/groupeng"> GitHub </a>.
  You can get the latest development code there. If you know how to use 
github please file issues there if you have problems or want to request 
features, or you can <a href="mailto:tom@dimiduk.net">email me</a>.
